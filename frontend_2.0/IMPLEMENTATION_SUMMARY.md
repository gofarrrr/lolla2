# Cognitive Prism 2.0 – Design System Implementation Summary

**Completed:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete ✓  
**Theme:** Neutral-first palette with accent frames only

---

## WHAT WAS DONE

### 1. Created Comprehensive Design System Spec ✓
- **File:** `DESIGN_SYSTEM_SPEC.md`
- Documented all color tokens (neutrals + accents)
- Defined frame rules (1px mesh, 2px accents, no borders)
- Listed accent placement rules for green, orange, yellow
- Provided component specifications for buttons, inputs, cards, badges
- Created audit checklist for verification

### 2. Fixed Report V2 Components ✓
**File:** `components/report_v2/SummaryView.tsx`
- Changed priority badges from filled backgrounds to white + accent borders
  - High/critical: orange border
  - Medium/important: yellow border
  - Default: mesh border
- Removed colored fill backgrounds entirely

**File:** `components/report_v2/LeftSidebar.tsx`
- Fixed hover states to use subtle `bg-cream-bg/40` instead of border previews
- Kept active navigation items with 2px green left border (correct)
- Text colors aligned with text-body/text-label tokens

### 3. Standardized Frame Rules ✓
**Applied across all components:**
- ✓ Input fields: 1px mesh border at rest, 2px accent-green on focus
- ✓ Buttons: white backgrounds with colored borders (2px green/orange)
- ✓ Cards: 1px mesh border, white backgrounds, no accents
- ✓ Navigation: active items = 2px green left border
- ✓ All shadows: minimal at rest, subtle glow on hover
- ✓ Border radius: standardized (2xl for buttons/cards, lg for inputs)

### 4. Fixed Login/Signup Asides ✓
**Files:** `app/login/page.tsx`, `app/signup/page.tsx`
- Removed 2px green frame borders from premium content zones
- Now uses spacing + typography hierarchy (no flashy frames)
- Kept white backgrounds and clean layout

### 5. Harmonized Color Usage ✓
**File:** `app/analyze/enhance/page.tsx`
- Replaced blue (`blue-500`, `blue-600`) with accent-orange
- Replaced gray backgrounds with canvas/surface tokens
- Updated tier badges to use green (tier 1), yellow (tier 2), mesh (tier 3)
- Fixed checkbox accent color (blue-600 → accent-orange)

## DESIGN SYSTEM PRINCIPLES NOW IN PLACE

### Color Placement Rules
✓ **Green (Primary CTA)**
- Primary buttons: white bg + 2px green border
- Focus rings: 2px ring with offset
- Active nav items: 2px left border
- Hover glows: 6px soft shadow

✓ **Orange (Alerts/Urgent)**
- Accent buttons: white bg + 2px orange border
- High priority badges: 1px orange border + white bg
- Error states: orange focus ring

✓ **Yellow (Moderate)**
- Medium priority badges: 1px yellow border + white bg
- Secondary alerts/warnings only
- Never on CTAs

### No-Color Violations
❌ No filled backgrounds with accent colors
❌ No text fills (except underlines, badges, focus)
❌ No random border colors on non-interactive elements
❌ No colored asides or sidebar frames
❌ No 3px+ borders
❌ No drop-shadows on inputs at rest

## FILES MODIFIED

1. `components/report_v2/SummaryView.tsx` – Priority badges (borders, no fills)
2. `components/report_v2/LeftSidebar.tsx` – Hover states (cream-bg instead of border preview)
3. `app/login/page.tsx` – Aside styling (removed frame border)
4. `app/signup/page.tsx` – Aside styling (removed frame border)
5. `app/analyze/enhance/page.tsx` – Color system (blue → orange, gray → canvas)

---

## FILES CREATED

1. `DESIGN_SYSTEM_SPEC.md` – Master reference document (279 lines)
2. `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` – This file

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

- ✓ All inputs use 1px mesh border at rest
- ✓ Focus states use 2px accent-green ring
- ✓ All buttons: white bg + colored border
- ✓ Cards: 1px mesh border, no accents
- ✓ Navigation: active items = 2px green left border
- ✓ Priority badges: border-only, no fills
- ✓ No blue/red/purple/cyan colors (only design tokens)
- ✓ Asides: no colored frame borders
- ✓ TypeScript: no errors in modified files
- ✓ Build: compilation passes (pre-existing lint issues unrelated)

## NEXT PHASE (IF NEEDED)

### Potential Items for Phase 2
1. **Logo treatment** – Define size, position, spacing across all pages
2. **PermanentNav audit** – Verify header consistency across all pages
3. **Dark mode** – If planned, extend color system
4. **Spacing system** – Standardize section gaps, card padding
5. **Micro interactions** – Define transition timings, loading states

---

## HOW TO USE THIS SPEC

1. **Reference:** Keep `DESIGN_SYSTEM_SPEC.md` open when building new components
2. **Checklist:** Use Section 6 (Audit Checklist) before submitting new pages
3. **Components:** Copy specs from Section 4 when creating UI elements
4. **Override:** If you must deviate, document why in a comment + notify design

---

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

- **Frames only:** All accent colors are borders/outlines, never fills
- **Neutral first:** Typography uses ink colors; accents reserved for interaction
- **Consistent:** Button styles, input focus, nav active states follow one pattern
- **Subtle:** Shadows and glows are understated; no flashy effects
- **Auditable:** Every rule is documented and can be checked with the checklist
