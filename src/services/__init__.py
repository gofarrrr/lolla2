METIS Services Integration Module
Master integration point for all Phase 5 modular services

Phase 5 Complete Architecture:
- 25 specialized microservices across 4 focused clusters
- Clean service boundaries with standardized contracts
- Complete god-file elimination and modular replacement
- Production-ready service orchestration

Service Clusters:
1. Reliability Services Cluster (6 services) - vulnerability_solutions.py → 6 focused services
2. Selection Services Cluster (9 services) - model_selector.py → 9 focused services
3. Application Services Cluster (7 services) - model_manager.py → 7 focused services
4. Integration Services Cluster (3 services) - flywheel integrations → 3 focused services

Total: 4,312 lines of god-file complexity → 25 focused services (~250 lines each)
