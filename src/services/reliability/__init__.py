"""
METIS Reliability Services Cluster
Complete modular decomposition of vulnerability_solutions.py god-file

Phase 5.1 Implementation - 6 Focused Services:
1. FailureDetectionService - Detect and classify failure modes
2. ExplorationStrategyService - Manage exploration vs exploitation
3. FeedbackOrchestrationService - Multi-tier feedback with incentives
4. ValidationEngineService - Multi-layer LLM validation
5. PatternGovernanceService - Emergent pattern discovery and governance
6. ReliabilityCoordinatorService - Coordinate all reliability services

Each service has single responsibility and clean contracts.
