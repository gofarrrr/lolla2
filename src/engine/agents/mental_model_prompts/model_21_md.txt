**Prompt Integration Guide**: Use Premortem for risk assessment and Backcasting for strategic planning. Premortem Prompt: 'Our project has failed one year from now. Let's do a premortem.

Core tools for GOP P3 (Strategic Phasing) and P6 (Bias Mitigation).

**Ethical Considerations**: Conducting a premortem is an act of ethical due diligence.

Backcasting can be used to ensure that the path to a desirable future does not involve unethical means.
