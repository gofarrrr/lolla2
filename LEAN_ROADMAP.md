# OPERATION LEAN: Refactoring Roadmap
## Data-Driven Code Complexity & Importance Audit

**Campaign**: Operation Lean - Phase 1
**Objective**: Identify and prioritize refactoring targets based on complexity AND importance
**Methodology**: Quantitative analysis across 4 dimensions (Complexity, Critical Path, Fan-In, Change Frequency)
**Scope**: 981 Python files in `lolly_v7/src/`
**Date**: 2025-10-18

---

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the complete lolly_v7 codebase (981 files), we have identified **Top 5 highest-priority refactoring targets** using a data-driven Importance Matrix that scores files across:

1. **Complexity Score** (30% weight): LOC + Cyclomatic Complexity
2. **Critical Path Score** (30% weight): Proximity to main.py and core API routes
3. **Fan-In Score** (25% weight): Number of imports (dependency centrality)
4. **Change Frequency Score** (15% weight): Estimated developer pain and modification frequency

### Key Findings

| Rank | File | Priority Score | LOC | Max CC | Fan-In | Status |
|------|------|----------------|-----|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | unified_context_stream.py | **5.41** | 384 | 18 | 184 | 🟡 IN PROGRESS (80%) |
| 2 | main.py | **5.08** | 822 | 6 | 0 | ✅ **COMPLETE** |
| 3 | method_actor_devils_advocate.py | **4.28** | 431 | 9 | 0 | ✅ **COMPLETE** |
| 4 | unified_client.py | **4.05** | 414 | 81 | 0 | ✅ **COMPLETE** |
| 5 | data_contracts.py | **4.02** | 1523 | 13 | 85 | ✅ **COMPLETE** |

**Guiding Principle**: "We will only refactor code that is both complex AND important."

## Top 5 Refactoring Targets

### 🎯 Target #1: `src/core/unified_context_stream.py`
**Priority Score: 5.41 (HIGHEST)**

#### The Data
- **LOC**: 384 (medium-large)
- **Max Cyclomatic Complexity**: 18 (`_calculate_summary_metrics`, `add_event`)
- **Fan-In**: 184 imports (HIGHEST in entire codebase - critical dependency)
- **Complexity Score**: 3.20
- **Critical Path Score**: 4.0 (core service)
- **Fan-In Score**: 10.0 (maximum - most imported file)
- **Change Frequency Score**: 5.0 (moderate)

#### The Diagnosis
**UnifiedContextStream** is the central nervous system of the V5.3 architecture - it manages all event-driven context with 184 imports across the codebase. However, it has grown into a **God Object** with multiple responsibilities:

1. **Event Management**: 40+ event types, validation, transition logic
2. **Evidence Extraction**: Consultant selection, synergy, CoreOps, contradiction evidence
3. **Formatting/Serialization**: XML, JSON, compressed formats
4. **Performance Metrics**: Session duration, confidence extraction, processing time
5. **Database Persistence**: Checkpoint management, database writes
6. **PII Scrubbing**: Security and privacy enforcement
7. **Subscriber Notifications**: Pub-sub pattern for real-time updates

**Key Problems**:
- Single file with 60+ methods handling unrelated concerns
- High fan-in (184) means any refactoring has system-wide impact
- Mixed abstraction levels (low-level formatting + high-level orchestration)
- Difficult to test in isolation due to cross-cutting concerns
- Violates Single Responsibility Principle

#### The Proposed Solution
**Apply Service Layer Extraction Pattern** - Break into 5 specialized services:

```
UnifiedContextStream (Core - 150 LOC)
├── EventValidationService (event schema, transitions, allowlist)
├── EvidenceExtractionService (consultant/synergy/CoreOps evidence)
├── ContextFormattingService (XML/JSON/compression formatting)
├── ContextPersistenceService (checkpoint/database integration)
└── ContextMetricsService (performance metrics, session analytics)
```

**Refactoring Strategy**:
1. Create contracts/interfaces for each service
2. Extract formatting logic first (lowest risk, highest LOC reduction)
3. Extract metrics calculation (independent, well-defined boundary)
4. Extract evidence extraction (reduce cognitive load)
5. Extract persistence layer (clean separation of concerns)
6. Keep core event management in UnifiedContextStream
7. Maintain backward compatibility via facade pattern during migration

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Reduce core file from 384 LOC → ~150 LOC
- Lower max CC from 18 → ~8
- Improve testability (5 focused test suites vs 1 massive suite)
- Preserve 184 fan-in via stable API facade
- Enable parallel development across services

---

### 🎯 Target #2: `src/main.py`
**Priority Score: 5.08**

#### The Data
- **LOC**: 822 (LARGEST file in codebase)
- **Max Cyclomatic Complexity**: 6 (low - good!)
- **Fan-In**: 0 (entry point - expected)
- **Complexity Score**: 4.44
- **Critical Path Score**: 10.0 (maximum - application entry point)
- **Fan-In Score**: 0.0 (entry point)
- **Change Frequency Score**: 5.0 (moderate)

#### The Diagnosis
**main.py** is the V5.3 entry point and has **excellent complexity metrics** (max CC of only 6), but at 822 LOC it violates the principle of a clean entry point. Analysis reveals it contains:

1. **Proper Concerns** (~300 LOC):
   - FastAPI application initialization
   - Service dependency injection wiring
   - API router registration
   - CORS and middleware configuration

2. **Misplaced Concerns** (~522 LOC):
   - 40+ stub endpoint implementations (`_stub_*` functions)
   - Business logic for confidence trace calculation (`_get_confidence_data`, `_compute_weighted_score`)
   - Analysis orchestration (`analyze_query`, `_generate_analysis_with_memory`)
   - Transparency dossier assembly (`get_transparency_dossier`)
   - System-2 tier classification logic (`classify_system2_tier`)

**Key Problems**:
- Entry point contains business logic (violates separation of concerns)
- Stub implementations should be in dedicated router modules
- Business logic should be in service layer, not main.py
- High LOC makes onboarding difficult for new developers
- Changes to business logic require modifying the entry point

#### The Proposed Solution
**Apply Vertical Slice Extraction Pattern** - Move business logic to appropriate layers:

```
main.py (Core Entry Point - ~300 LOC)
├── src/api/routes/confidence_routes.py (confidence trace logic)
├── src/api/routes/transparency_routes.py (transparency dossier)
├── src/services/analysis_orchestration_service.py (analysis execution)
├── src/services/system2_classification_service.py (tier classification)
└── src/api/routes/stub_routes.py (temporary stub endpoints)
```

**Refactoring Strategy**:
1. Create `confidence_routes.py` and move all `*confidence*` functions
2. Create `transparency_routes.py` and move transparency dossier assembly
3. Move `analyze_query` and analysis helpers to `AnalysisOrchestrationService`
4. Move `classify_system2_tier` to dedicated service
5. Consolidate all `_stub_*` functions into `stub_routes.py`
6. Update main.py to register new routers
7. Validate all endpoints still work via integration tests

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Reduce main.py from 822 LOC → ~300 LOC (63% reduction)
- Clean separation: infrastructure (main.py) vs business logic (services)
- Easier testing of business logic in isolation
- Simpler onboarding for new developers
- Entry point becomes a "wiring diagram" of the system

---

### 🎯 Target #3: `src/core/method_actor_devils_advocate.py`
**Priority Score: 4.28**

#### The Data
- **LOC**: 431 (large)
- **Max Cyclomatic Complexity**: 9 (`run_method_actor_critique`)
- **Fan-In**: 0 (specialized system)
- **Complexity Score**: 2.76
- **Critical Path Score**: 8.0 (core cognitive feature)
- **Fan-In Score**: 0.0 (specialized)
- **Change Frequency Score**: 7.0 (high - feature enhancements)

#### The Diagnosis
**MethodActorDevilsAdvocate** implements the hybrid algorithmic + Method Actor approach for the ULTRATHINK challenge engine. It's a well-architected component but suffers from:

1. **Feature Bloat**: 23 methods with mixed responsibilities
   - YAML config loading
   - Persona initialization (Munger, Ackoff)
   - Dialogue generation
   - Forward motion action conversion
   - Safety/quality metric calculation
   - Evidence recording
   - Demo/testing functions

2. **Configuration Complexity**: Heavy reliance on YAML parsing with multiple fallback paths

3. **Tight Coupling**: Direct integration with `EnhancedDevilsAdvocateSystem` and `UnifiedContextStream`

**Key Problems**:
- Single class with 23 methods handling persona management, dialogue generation, and metric calculation
- YAML configuration logic mixed with business logic
- No clear separation between persona engines (Munger vs Ackoff)
- Difficult to add new personas without modifying core class
- Testing requires full YAML configuration setup

#### The Proposed Solution
**Apply Strategy Pattern + Plugin Architecture** - Separate persona engines and configuration:

```
MethodActorDevilsAdvocate (Orchestrator - ~150 LOC)
├── PersonaEngine Interface
│   ├── MungerPersonaEngine (investment wisdom, pattern recognition)
│   ├── AckoffPersonaEngine (systems thinking, assumption dissolution)
│   └── [Future: CustomPersonaEngine - pluggable]
├── ForwardMotionConverter (challenge → experiment conversion)
├── SafetyAssessor (psychological safety, enabling challenger score)
└── ConfigurationLoader (YAML parsing, thin variables)
```

**Refactoring Strategy**:
1. Define `PersonaEngine` abstract interface
2. Extract Munger-specific logic into `MungerPersonaEngine` (~100 LOC)
3. Extract Ackoff-specific logic into `AckoffPersonaEngine` (~80 LOC)
4. Extract forward motion conversion into dedicated service (~60 LOC)
5. Extract safety assessment into `SafetyAssessor` (~40 LOC)
6. Extract YAML config into `ConfigurationLoader` (~50 LOC)
7. Orchestrator becomes a lightweight coordinator (~150 LOC)

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Reduce main file from 431 LOC → ~150 LOC
- Enable plugin architecture for new personas (no code changes to core)
- Improve testability (test each persona engine independently)
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Easier to add new personas (e.g., Ray Dalio, Jeff Bezos personas)

### 🎯 Target #4: `src/integrations/llm/unified_client.py`
**Priority Score: 4.05**

#### The Data
- **LOC**: 414 (large)
- **Max Cyclomatic Complexity**: 81 (`call_llm` - HIGHEST CC in codebase!)
- **Fan-In**: 0 (integration layer)
- **Complexity Score**: 8.01 (HIGHEST - driven by CC=81)
- **Critical Path Score**: 2.0 (integration layer)
- **Fan-In Score**: 0.0 (integration)
- **Change Frequency Score**: 7.0 (high - LLM provider changes)

#### The Diagnosis
**UnifiedLLMClient** has a **CRITICAL CODE SMELL**: `call_llm()` function with **467 total lines** and **CC=81** (cyclomatic complexity). This is the highest complexity in the entire codebase.

**Current State**: Refactoring is **IN PROGRESS but INCOMPLETE**:
- ✅ Pipeline architecture implemented (lines 569-611, ~42 lines)
- ❌ Legacy fallback code still present (lines 614-985, **~372 lines**)
- ⚠️ Pipeline enabled by default but legacy code acts as safety net
- ⚠️ 372 lines of duplicate logic creating maintenance burden

The massive monolithic function contains:

1. **Multiple LLM Provider Orchestration**: OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, DeepSeek
2. **Security Layer Integration**: PII redaction, sensitivity routing, injection firewall
3. **Quality Control**: Output contracts, grounding validation, self-verification
4. **Caching Logic**: Intelligent cache with multiple strategies
5. **Error Handling**: Provider fallback, retry logic, error classification
6. **Telemetry**: Performance tracking, cost calculation, audit trail

**Key Problems**:
- 372 lines of legacy fallback code still in function (80% of function is leftovers)
- 81 decision points in legacy path (maintainability nightmare)
- Duplicate logic between pipeline and legacy paths
- Pipeline refactoring started but not completed
- Adding new providers/features: do we update pipeline or legacy or both?
- Unclear migration plan for completing the refactoring

#### The Proposed Solution
**Apply Pipeline Pattern + Chain of Responsibility** - Already partially implemented (`create_llm_pipeline`):

```
UnifiedLLMClient (Facade - ~100 LOC)
└── LLMPipeline
    ├── SecurityStage
    │   ├── PIIRedactionHandler
    │   ├── SensitivityRoutingHandler
    │   └── InjectionFirewallHandler
    ├── QualityStage
    │   ├── OutputContractValidator
    │   ├── GroundingContractValidator
    │   └── SelfVerificationHandler
    ├── ExecutionStage
    │   ├── CacheCheckHandler
    │   ├── ProviderSelectionHandler
    │   ├── ProviderExecutionHandler
    │   └── FallbackHandler
    └── TelemetryStage
        ├── PerformanceTracker
        ├── CostCalculator
        └── AuditLogger
```

**Refactoring Strategy**:
1. **COMPLETED**: Pipeline architecture implemented (`create_llm_pipeline`, lines 569-611) ✅
2. **IN PROGRESS**: Legacy fallback code removal (lines 614-985, 372 lines) ⚠️
3. **NEXT STEPS** - Complete the migration:
   - Verify all pipeline stages are functionally complete
   - Run comprehensive integration tests with pipeline enabled
   - Monitor production for 1-2 sprints to validate pipeline stability
   - **Remove legacy fallback code** (lines 614-985) once pipeline proven stable
   - Keep pipeline failure logging for post-removal monitoring
   - Clean up: remove `pipeline_enabled` flag after legacy code removed

**Critical Decision Required**:
- **Option A (Aggressive)**: Remove legacy code NOW if pipeline tests pass
- **Option B (Conservative)**: Keep legacy fallback for 2 more sprints, monitor production
- **Recommendation**: Option B - Legacy code provides safety net, remove after stability proven

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Reduce `call_llm()` from 467 lines → ~95 lines (80% reduction)
- Reduce CC from 81 → ~5 (via delegation to pipeline)
- Remove 372 lines of duplicate legacy code
- Single source of truth for LLM call logic
- Eliminate confusion about which code path to update
- **CRITICAL**: This is the most important refactoring completion for code quality

### 🎯 Target #5: `src/engine/models/data_contracts.py`
**Priority Score: 4.02**

#### The Data
- **LOC**: 636 (SECOND LARGEST file)
- **Max Cyclomatic Complexity**: 13 (`get` method)
- **Fan-In**: 85 imports (SECOND HIGHEST - critical data structures)
- **Complexity Score**: 4.06
- **Critical Path Score**: 3.0 (data layer)
- **Fan-In Score**: 4.62
- **Change Frequency Score**: 5.0 (moderate)

#### The Diagnosis
**data_contracts.py** is the V5.3 data layer backbone with 85 imports across the codebase. Analysis reveals it's a **Mega Model File** containing:

1. **Domain Model Classes** (Pydantic models for business entities)
2. **Validation Functions** (model selection, bias scores, weights, distributions)
3. **Transformation Functions** (legacy conversion, CloudEvents mapping)
4. **Factory Functions** (event creation for various engagement types)
5. **Memory Management** (size calculation, compression, limits enforcement)

**Key Problems**:
- Single file with 636 LOC containing unrelated data structures
- Mixed responsibilities (models + validation + transformation + factories)
- High fan-in (85) means changes have wide ripple effects
- No clear domain boundaries within the file
- Validation logic scattered across multiple functions
- Factory functions mixed with data models

#### The Proposed Solution
**Apply Domain-Driven Design - Bounded Context Separation**:

```
data_contracts/ (Package)
├── models/
│   ├── engagement_models.py (EngagementState, EngagementConfig)
│   ├── consultant_models.py (ConsultantBlueprint, ConsultantMatrix)
│   ├── analysis_models.py (AnalysisResult, PipelineOutput)
│   └── event_models.py (ContextEvent, EvidenceEvent)
├── validators/
│   ├── model_validators.py (validate_model_selection, validate_bias_scores)
│   ├── distribution_validators.py (validate_strategic_layer, validate_cognitive)
│   └── memory_validators.py (enforce_memory_limits, enforce_size_limit)
├── transformers/
│   ├── legacy_transformer.py (get_legacy_three, backward compatibility)
│   └── cloudevents_transformer.py (to_cloudevents_dict, from_cloudevents_dict)
└── factories/
    ├── engagement_factory.py (create_engagement_initiated_event)
    ├── model_selection_factory.py (create_model_selection_event)
    └── assessment_factory.py (create_vulnerability_assessment_event)
```

**Refactoring Strategy**:
1. Create package structure `src/engine/models/data_contracts/`
2. Move engagement-related models to `engagement_models.py` (~150 LOC)
3. Move consultant-related models to `consultant_models.py` (~100 LOC)
4. Move all validators to `validators/` package (~150 LOC)
5. Move all transformers to `transformers/` package (~80 LOC)
6. Move all factories to `factories/` package (~120 LOC)
7. Keep core contracts in `data_contracts/__init__.py` (~50 LOC)
8. Update 85 imports gradually (use `__init__.py` re-exports for compatibility)

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Break 636 LOC monolith into 7-8 focused modules (~80-150 LOC each)
- Clear domain boundaries (models vs validators vs factories)
- Easier to find and modify specific functionality
- Reduced blast radius for changes (validator changes don't affect models)
- Improved testability (test validators independently from models)
- Maintain backward compatibility via `__init__.py` re-exports
