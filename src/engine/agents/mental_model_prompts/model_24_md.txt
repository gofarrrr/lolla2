**Category**: analytical
**Description**: Mental model extracted from database

**Key Concepts**:
• Core principle
• Key insight
• Application method

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Identify the problem context
2. Apply the mental model framework
3. Analyze using key concepts
4. Generate insights and conclusions
5. Validate results and iterate

**Application Context**: General Problem Solving

**Bias Vulnerabilities**: oversimplification, garbage_in_garbage_out, misinterpretation_of_distributions

**Works Well With**: 

**Conflicts With**: 

**Prompt Integration Guide**: Use for risk analysis and forecasting under uncertainty. Prompt: 'Let's build a Monte Carlo simulation for our project's budget. Define the key uncertain variables (e.g., material costs, labor hours) and their probability distributions. Run 10,000 trials to generate a distribution of potential final costs and determine the probability of exceeding our budget.' Key for rigorous GOP P2 (Contextual Parameterization).

**Ethical Considerations**: The primary ethical risk lies in the transparency of the model's assumptions. Presenting a Monte Carlo simulation's output as objective truth without clearly stating the subjective probability distributions used for the inputs is a form of deception. Ethical use requires a clear communication of the model's assumptions and limitations.
