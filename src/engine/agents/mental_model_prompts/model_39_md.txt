**Prompt Integration Guide**: Use to structure and facilitate a group problem-solving session. Prompt: 'Facilitate a discussion on this strategic decision using the Six Thinking Hats. We will proceed in the following order: Blue (agenda), White (data), Green (ideas), Yellow (benefits), Black (risks), Red (gut feelings), Blue (summary and next steps). Let's start with the White Hat: what are the objective facts we know?'

**Ethical Considerations**: The primary ethical responsibility falls on the facilitator (Blue Hat). It is unethical to use the framework to manipulate a group towards a predetermined outcome by selectively emphasizing certain hats, misrepresenting contributions, or stifling genuine exploration. The facilitator's duty is to ensure a fair, transparent, and impartial process.
