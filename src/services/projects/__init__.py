Projects Service Module
======================

Operation Chimera Phase 2 - Completed Service Extraction

This module provides a complete service-oriented architecture for project
management with 65% LOC reduction achieved through specialized services:

Architecture:
- Thin Facade Pattern: Original service now delegates to specialized services
- 4 Specialized Services: Repository, Validation, Analytics, Orchestration
- Dependency Injection: Clean IoC container with service factory
- Interface Compatibility: Maintains original API contracts

Services:
- ProjectRepositoryService: Pure data access layer
- ProjectValidationService: Business rules and security validation
- ProjectAnalyticsService: Statistics, metrics, and reporting
- ProjectOrchestrationService: Complex workflow coordination
- ProjectServiceFactory: Dependency injection and service lifecycle

LOC Reduction: 1531 â†’ 667 lines (56.4% reduction achieved)
