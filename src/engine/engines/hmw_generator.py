HMW (How Might We) Question Generator
Targeted implementation from Ideaflow methodology for creative problem reframing

Implements the "Six Dials" approach in a focused, enterprise-friendly way:
- Scale (bigger/smaller)
- Quality (better/worse)
- Emotion (feelings/motivations)
- Stakes (what if/consequences)
- Expectations (assumptions/should be)
- Analogy (like other domains)
