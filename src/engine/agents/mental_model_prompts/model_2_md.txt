**Prompt Integration Guide**: When evaluating strategic decisions, instruct the AI to perform a second-order analysis. Prompt: 'Analyze the immediate, first-order consequences of this decision. Then, for each of those consequences, analyze the second-order effects. Continue to the third order where significant.' Essential for GOP P2 (Contextual Parameterization) to map systemic impacts and P8 (Adaptive Depth) to explore long-term implications.

**Ethical Considerations**: This is a cornerstone of ethical decision-making, especially within a consequentialist framework. It is the primary tool for identifying and mitigating potential long-term harm to diverse or 'invisible' stakeholders who are not affected by first-order outcomes.
