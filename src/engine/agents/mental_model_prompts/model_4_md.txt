**Conflicts With**: 

**Prompt Integration Guide**: Use to critique analyses and demand higher standards of evidence. Prompt: 'Critique this conclusion. Has the author demonstrated causation, or are they merely observing a correlation? Identify potential confounding variables or alternative explanations.' Essential for GOP P4 (Critique & Refinement) and P6 (Bias Mitigation).

**Ethical Considerations**: Acting on correlation as if it were causation can lead to deeply unethical and harmful policies. For example, creating discriminatory policies based on a demographic's correlation with a negative outcome, while ignoring the true causal factor (e.g., systemic poverty), constitutes a major ethical failure.
