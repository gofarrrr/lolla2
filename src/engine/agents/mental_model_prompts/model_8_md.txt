**Conflicts With**: 

**Prompt Integration Guide**: Use for planning and problem-solving tasks. Prompt: 'Take this complex project and apply decomposition. Break it down into a Work Breakdown Structure with at least three levels of detail: Phases, Major Deliverables, and specific Tasks.' A core process for GOP P3 (Strategic Phasing) and a prerequisite for many analyses in GOP P4 (Critique & Refinement).

**Ethical Considerations**: When decomposing ethical dilemmas, there is a risk of analyzing components in isolation and missing the emergent ethical harm that arises from their interaction. A purely decompositional approach must be followed by a systemic, ethical synthesis to be responsible.
